#Install and load a package 
install.packages("tidyverse") 

 library("tidyverse")  // require("tidyverse")

# packages contain databases to practise on, to view them -->  data() 

# to view a summary of a database (example = msleep)
glimpse(msleep) 

# To view a database 
view(msleep) 

# To rename a coloumn / variable - (%>% = AND THEN)
msleep %>%
+ rename("conserv" = "conservation")

## Changing variable type

 msleep$sleep_total <- as.factor(msleep$sleep_total)  - This changes sleep_total from a dbl to a factor

> glimpse(msleep) - to check if change has been done 

## OR can also do it like:
msleep%>%
+ mutate(sleep_total = as.double(sleep_total)) %>%
+ glimpse()
## this  changes sleep_total to a Double variable type -- which just means it stored with 2 decimal points 

## Show coloumn names in our database 
names(msleep) 

## Selecting a group of variables
msleep %>%
+ select(2:5, awake              ## 2:5 demands the coloums from 2 to 5
+ , starts_with("sleep"),        ## starts_with 
+ contains("wt"))%>%             ## contains (any letters you want)
+ names()                        ## must end with names to tell R thats what you want

## FILTERING AND ARRANGING DATA

unique(msleep$order)       ## this shows you all possible observations for a given variable
